## Ingredients

### Khao Soi Curry Paste

- 2 pods black cardamom
- 1.5 tbsp coriander seeds
- 0.75 oz (21 g) ginger, thinly sliced
- 1.5-inch piece (5 g) fresh turmeric, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup shallots, sliced ¼-inch thick
- 0.75 oz (21 g) mild dried chilies (guajillo or puya)
- 1 tsp coarse salt

### Curry Broth

- 1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
- 3 cups (710 ml) water or unsalted chicken stock
- 1.5 lb (700 g) chicken drumsticks (about 5-6)
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp black soy sauce (or dark soy sauce)
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped

### Noodles and Toppings

- 1 lb (450 g) fresh wheat-based egg noodles (wonton noodles)
- Neutral oil for frying (about 1-2 cups)

### Condiments

- 1 lime, cut into wedges
- ¼ cup shallots or red onion, chopped
- ½ cup pickled mustard greens, chopped
- Fried chili flakes (roasted chili flakes in oil)

## Instructions

### Make the Curry Paste

1. Remove stems and seeds from dried chilies; cut into chunks. Soak in water if using a blender, or keep dry for mortar and pestle.
2. Remove seeds from black cardamom pods. In a dry skillet, toast cardamom seeds and coriander seeds over medium heat until fragrant.
3. In the same skillet, sear ginger and turmeric slices until slightly charred. Remove.
4. Add shallots to the skillet and char them slightly; remove.
5. Using a mortar and pestle, pound the chilies and salt into a paste. Add charred ginger and turmeric; pound until fine.
6. Add toasted seeds and pound. Finally, add charred shallots and pound until a smooth paste forms.

### Prepare the Broth

1. In a medium pot, add ½ cup (120 ml) of the coconut milk and bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. Add the curry paste and stir constantly for a few minutes until the mixture is very thick and coconut oil starts to sizzle around the edges.
3. Add the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk and stir to dissolve the paste.
4. Add the chicken drumsticks, water (or stock), soy sauce, black soy sauce, fish sauce, and palm sugar.
5. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and simmer gently for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is fork-tender.

### Prepare the Noodles

1. Set aside about 3 oz (85 g) of the fresh noodles for frying.
2. Heat oil in a wok or small pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry the reserved noodles in small handfuls until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels.
3. Cook the remaining noodles in boiling water according to package instructions (usually 1-2 minutes). Drain and divide into serving bowls.

### Assembly

1. Ladle the curry broth and one or two chicken drumsticks over the soft noodles.
2. Top with a generous nest of crispy fried noodles.
3. Serve immediately with a side plate of lime wedges, shallots, pickled mustard greens, and chili flakes.

## Tips

- **The Paste**: Charring the aromatics (ginger, turmeric, shallots) is key to the smoky, deep flavor of a traditional Khao Soi.
- **Coconut Milk**: Use a high-quality Thai brand (like Aroy-D) to ensure there is enough fat to "crack" the cream when sautéing the paste.
- **Noodles**: If using dry noodles, follow the package instructions to rehydrate before boiling or frying.

## Modifications

- **Turmeric**: Substitute 1 teaspoon ground turmeric if fresh is unavailable.
- **Chicken**: Chicken thighs (bone-in) can be used instead of drumsticks. You can also substitute beef for the chicken as well. 
- **Vegetarian**: Use firm tofu or mushrooms and substitute fish sauce with more soy sauce or salt.
- **Onions**: Red onion can be used as a substitute for shallots in the condiments.
