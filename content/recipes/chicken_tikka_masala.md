## Ingredients

### For the Chicken Marinade
- 28 oz (800g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper)
- 1 teaspoon salt

### For the Sauce
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 small onions (or 1 large onion) finely diced
- 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 14 oz (400g) tomato puree (tomato sauce/passata)
- 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups heavy cream (thickened cream)
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1/4 cup water (if needed)
- 4 tablespoons fresh cilantro/coriander (to garnish)

## Instructions

### Marinating and Searing
1. In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cumin, Kashmiri chili, and salt. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes (preferably overnight for best flavor).
2. Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces (shake off excess marinade first). Fry until browned on both sides (about 3 minutes per side). Remove from the pan and set aside.

### Making the Sauce
3. In the same pan, melt the butter. Sauté the onions until soft and golden. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Stir in the garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and coriander. Sauté for about 20 seconds until fragrant.
5. Pour in the tomato puree, Kashmiri chili, and salt. Cover and simmer on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and turns a deep red color.

### Combining
6. Stir in the heavy cream and brown sugar.
7. Add the cooked chicken and its juices back into the pan. Simmer for an additional 8-10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.
8. If the sauce is too thick, stir in the water to reach your desired consistency.
9. Garnish with cilantro and serve with garlic naan or basmati rice.

## Tips

- **Chicken Thighs**: Using chicken thighs is recommended as they stay juicy and tender. You may also use chicken breast or paneer.
- **Batches**: Do not overcrowd the pan when searing the chicken, or the chicken will release juices and steam rather than brown.
- **Kashmiri Chili**: This is a mild chili that provides the signature red color. If you use cayenne instead, start with half the amount as it is much hotter.

## Modifications

- **Dairy-Free**: Use coconut cream in place of heavy cream and use oil or a vegan butter substitute in place of the butter.
- **Lower Fat**: You can substitute heavy cream with evaporated milk, though the sauce will be slightly thinner.
- **Spice Level**: Adjust the heat by increasing or decreasing the amount of Kashmiri chili or cayenne pepper used in both the marinade and the sauce.
