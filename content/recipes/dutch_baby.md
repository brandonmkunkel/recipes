**Prep time**: 5 minutes
**Cook time**: 35 minutes
**Total time**: 40 minutes
**Yield**: 3 to 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar, or cinnamon sugar (for serving)

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Combine eggs, flour, milk, sugar, and nutmeg in a blender and blend until very smooth. Alternatively, whisk by hand until well combined.
3. Place butter in a heavy 10-inch skillet and transfer to the oven. Once butter has melted (watch closely to prevent burning), pour the batter into the skillet.
4. Return the skillet to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancake is puffed and golden.
5. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F (150°C) and bake for 5 minutes longer.
6. Remove from oven, slice into wedges, and serve immediately with your desired toppings.

## Tips

- Make sure eggs and milk are at room temperature for best rise.
- Use a blender for the smoothest batter, but hand-mixing works too.
- Serve quickly—the pancake will deflate as it cools.
- Try with fresh fruit, whipped cream, or sautéed apples for variety.
