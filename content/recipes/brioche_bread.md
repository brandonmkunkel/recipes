**Prep time**: 40 minutes (plus 15 hours proofing)
**Cook time**: 35 minutes
**Total time**: ~16 hours
**Servings**: 4–6

## Ingredients

### Brioche Dough
- 250 gram (2 cups) Bread flour
- 30 gram (2 tablespoons) Caster sugar
- 5 gram (1 teaspoon) Salt
- 5 gram (1.5 teaspoon) Instant dry yeast
- 3 Eggs (150 gram, shells excluded), cold
- 125 gram (1/2 cup or 1 stick plus 1 Tbsp) Unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
- 3 ml (1/2 tsp) Vanilla extract
- 3 ml (1/2 tsp) Bergamot extract

### Topping and Glaze
- 1 Egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- Sliced or slivered almonds
- 45 gram (1/3 cup) Icing sugar
- 10 ml (2 tsp) Honey
- 10 ml (2 tsp) Lemon juice

## Instructions

### Mixing and Kneading
1. In a mixing bowl, combine bread flour, sugar, and salt. Mix well, then add the instant yeast and mix again.
2. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the eggs and extracts (vanilla and bergamot).
3. Using dough hooks on a stand mixer, knead at low speed for 3–4 minutes until ingredients are incorporated into a dough.
4. Increase to medium speed and knead for 5–7 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. The dough temperature should ideally be between 26–27°C (77–80°F).
5. Add the softened butter in chunks. Knead at low speed for 3–4 minutes to incorporate, then increase to medium speed for another 3–5 minutes until the dough is smooth and shiny. Do not over-knead.

### Proofing and Chilling
6. Wrap the dough in parchment paper and let it rest at room temperature (18–23°C / 64–74°F) for 20–30 minutes.
7. Transfer the wrapped dough to the refrigerator (2–4°C / 35–39°F) and proof for 12–14 hours.

### Shaping
8. Divide the chilled dough into three equal parts. Cover with plastic wrap and return to the fridge for 20 minutes to relax.
9. Working with one piece at a time (keeping the others chilled), roll the dough into a 35–40 cm long stick. Repeat with the remaining pieces.
10. Once all are rolled, return to the first piece and roll it further to approximately 60 cm. Repeat for the others. 
11. Braid the three strands together. Form the braid into a circle (wreath) and pinch the ends together. 
12. Place on a lined baking tray, cover with a proofing box, and let rise at room temperature (20–24°C / 68–75°F) for 2–3 hours or until doubled in size.

### Baking and Finishing
13. Preheat the oven to 170°C (338°F) with top and bottom heat.
14. Gently apply the egg wash over the dough and sprinkle with sliced almonds.
15. Bake at 170°C (338°F) for about 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes until golden brown.
16. While the bread cools on a rack, whisk together the icing sugar, honey, and lemon juice to create the glaze.
17. Once the brioche has cooled slightly, drizzle the honey lemon glaze over the top.

## Tips

- **Temperature Control**: It is crucial to keep the dough cool so the butter does not melt. If the dough feels too warm or oily during kneading or shaping, return it to the fridge immediately.
- **Hydration Adjustments**: Different flours have different absorption levels. If the dough is too stiff, add a lightly beaten egg (1–2 teaspoons at a time) or a little milk until it becomes soft and smooth.
- **Browning**: If the bread turns dark too quickly during baking, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.
- **Storage**: Brioche can be stored in a sealed bag for up to 4 days at room temperature or frozen for 6–8 weeks.

## Modifications

- **Yeast**: This recipe specifically requires **Instant Yeast**. If using Active Dry yeast, it must be activated in a small amount of warm liquid first (though the original recipe does not include liquid for this).
- **Sugar**: The amount of caster sugar can be increased to taste if a sweeter bread is desired.
- **Egg Wash**: The beaten egg can be substituted with water or milk for a lighter crust.
- **Flavoring**: Vanilla and bergamot extracts are optional and can be adjusted or replaced with other extracts like orange blossom water or citrus zest.
