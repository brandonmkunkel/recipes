**Prep time**: 20 mins
**Cook time**: 45 mins
**Total time**: 1 hr 20 mins
**Servings**: 10 waffles

## Ingredients

### Yeast Mixture

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- ¾ cup lukewarm milk (no more than 100°F/40°C)

### Dough

- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup melted butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups flour
- ½ teaspoon salt

### Inclusions

- 1 ½ cups pearl sugar

## Instructions

### Activate Yeast

1. Sprinkle the active dry yeast and white sugar over the warm milk in a small bowl.
2. Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.

### Prepare the Dough

3. Whisk the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract into the yeast mixture until evenly blended. Set aside.
4. In a separate large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
5. Pour the egg and yeast mixture into the well. Stir until a soft dough forms.
6. Cover the bowl with a light cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place (80 to 95°F / 27 to 35°C) until it has doubled in volume, approximately 30 minutes.
7. Gently mix the pearl sugar into the risen dough.

### Cook the Waffles

8. Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
9. Place a baseball-sized ball of dough onto the preheated waffle iron.
10. Cook until the waffles are golden and crisp, about 2 minutes.
11. Repeat with the remaining dough.
12. Allow the waffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving to let the sugar coating harden.

## Tips

- **Sourcing Sugar**: Belgian pearl sugar is specifically designed for these waffles and can often be found online if not available in local stores.
- **Advance Prep**: If you would like to cook the waffles later, you can shape the dough into balls, wrap them in plastic wrap or waxed paper, and refrigerate them overnight.
- **Temperature Control**: Ensure the milk is not hotter than 100°F (40°C), as higher temperatures can kill the yeast.
