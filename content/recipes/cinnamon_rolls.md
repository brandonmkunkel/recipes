# Cinnamon Rolls

This recipe is a recreation from Todd Wilbur's book "More Top Secret Recipes".

**Prep time**: 1 hour + (for rising)
**Cook time**: 10 minutes
**Total time**: 1 hour 10 minutes +
**Servings**: 12 rolls

## Ingredients

**Rolls:**
- 4 to 4 1/4 cups (480g to 510g) All-Purpose Flour
- 3/4 cup (170g) lukewarm water
- 1 stick of butter (115g)
- 3 tablespoons (63g) honey
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) table salt
- 4 teaspoons (12g) instant yeast

**Filling:**
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 3 tbsp cinnamon
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted

**Icing:**
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1/4 cup (2 oz.) cream cheese
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt

## Instructions

1.  For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl.
2.  Add the sugar, butter, salt, eggs and flour and mix well.
3.  Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.
4.  Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough flat until it is approximately 21 inches long and 16 inches wide. It should be about 1/4 inch thick.
5.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
6.  For the filling, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Spread the melted butter evenly over the surface of the dough, and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar evenly over the surface.
7.  Working carefully from the top (a 21 inch side), roll the dough down to the bottom edge.
8.  Cut the rolled dough into 1 3/4 inch slices and place 6 at a time, evenly spaced, in a lightly greased baking pan. Bake for 10-20 minutes, or until light brown on top.
9.  While the rolls bake, combine the icing ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy.
10. When the rolls come out of the oven, coat each generously with icing.
