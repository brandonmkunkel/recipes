- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add flour and stir until combined. Cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.

## Tips

- Stir frequently while cooking to prevent the pasta from sticking.
- Add a splash more water or milk if the sauce becomes too thick.
- Mix in your favorite extras like cooked bacon, peas, or hot sauce for variety.

## Modifications

- Use more cheese!
- For a creamier texture use heavy cream or half and half.
- Use a different blend of cheeses: Other cheeses that can work well in place of (or mixed with) cheddar could include fontina, gouda, gruyere, havarti, Monterrey Jack, or pepperjack cheese.
- Add a protein: Chicken, beef, pork, bacon (or guanciale, pancetta, prosciutto, etc), sausage, shrimp, salmon, scallops, or plant-based “meats”
- Add veggies or greens: Asparagus, bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, fennel, green beans, kale, mushrooms, onions, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini or other pasta-friendly veggies would be great.
- Add extra seasonings: There are endless ways that you could play around with the seasonings in this macaroni and cheese recipe. You could add in some additional fresh or dried herbs (such as basil, chives, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, etc), other seasonings that you enjoy (such Cajun seasoning, herbs de Provence, za’atar, etc), lemon juice, or additional sauces (such as basil pesto, Mexican salsa verde, pumpkin purée, etc).
