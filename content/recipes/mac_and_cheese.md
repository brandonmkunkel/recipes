**Total time**: 30 minutes  
**Yield**: 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 3 cups water
- 4 cups milk
- 1 lb uncooked pasta (such as macaroni, shells, etc.)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 4-5 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add flour and stir until combined. Cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.
2. Pour in 1 cup of water, stir or whisk until the mixture is completely smooth. Gradually pour tin the reimaining water and milk, stirring until evenly combined.
3. Stir in the pasta, salt, and spices until combined. Continue cooking until the mixture just reaches a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a low simmer. Continue cooking for 9-10 minutes or until pasta is al dente.
4. Remove from heat and stir in the cheeses until melted and incorporated.
5. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.

## Tips

- Stir frequently while cooking to prevent the pasta from sticking.
- Add a splash more water or milk if the sauce becomes too thick.
- Mix in your favorite extras like cooked bacon, peas, or hot sauce for variety.

## Modifications

- Use more cheese!
- For a creamier texture use heavy cream or half and half.
- Use a different blend of cheeses: Other cheeses that can work well in place of (or mixed with) cheddar could include fontina, gouda, gruyere, havarti, Monterrey Jack, or pepperjack cheese.
- Add a protein: Chicken, beef, pork, bacon (or guanciale, pancetta, prosciutto, etc), sausage, shrimp, salmon, scallops, or plant-based “meats”
- Add veggies or greens: Asparagus, bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, fennel, green beans, kale, mushrooms, onions, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini or other pasta-friendly veggies would be great.
- Add extra seasonings: There are endless ways that you could play around with the seasonings in this macaroni and cheese recipe. You could add in some additional fresh or dried herbs (such as basil, chives, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, etc), other seasonings that you enjoy (such Cajun seasoning, herbs de Provence, za’atar, etc), lemon juice, or additional sauces (such as basil pesto, Mexican salsa verde, pumpkin purée, etc).
