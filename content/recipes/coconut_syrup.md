**Prep time**: 0 minutes
**Cook time**: 15 minutes
**Total time**: 15 minutes
**Servings**: 8 Servings

## Ingredients

- 13 ounces full-fat coconut milk (not lite)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/2 cup coconut sugar sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (or up to 3/4 teaspoon, to taste)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1.  Open the can of coconut milk. If the coconut milk has separated, pour the thin liquid into a small saucepan (with the heat off) and whisk in the cornstarch thoroughly until completely incorporated. Then add the coconut cream. If it hasn't separated, pour all of the coconut milk into the saucepan with the heat off and whisk in the cornstarch.
2.  Turn the heat to medium. Add the sugar and salt to the saucepan.
3.  Stir very frequently over medium heat until the liquid starts to thicken. If you start to see bubbles from boiling, take it off the heat immediately.
4.  Remove from heat and add the vanilla extract, stirring to combine.
5.  The syrup will continue to thicken as it cools. Serve with your favorite pancakes, waffles, or crepes.

## Tips

- Whisk the cornstarch into the coconut milk _before_ turning on the heat to prevent lumps.
- If you do end up with chunks of cornstarch, you can strain the syrup when it's finished.
- The syrup will thicken considerably as it cools.

## Modifications

- **Substitute extracts**: Experiment with different extracts like coconut extract or rum extract for the vanilla.
- **Sugar alternative**: Use brown or white sugar if you don't have access to coconut sugar
- **Add more coconut**: If you like the taste and texture of shredded sweetened coconut, you can add about ½ cup of it to the syrup. Toasted coconut or coconut flakes can also be added for extra flavor and texture.
