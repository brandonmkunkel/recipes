**Prep time**: 15 minutes
**Cook time**: 0 minutes
**Total time**: 14 days (minimum aging time)
**Yield**: 16 servings

## Ingredients

- 12 large eggs (pasteurized if you need peace of mind)
- 1 pound sugar
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (plus more for serving)
- 1 pint half-and-half
- 1 pint whole milk
- 1 pint heavy cream
- 1 cup Jamaican rum
- 1 cup cognac
- 1 cup bourbon
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Separate the eggs and store the whites for another purpose.
2. Beat the yolks with the sugar and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl until the mixture lightens in color and falls off the whisk in a solid "ribbon."
3. Combine dairy, booze, and salt in a second bowl or pitcher and then slowly beat into the egg mixture.
4. Move to a large glass jar (or a couple of smaller ones) and store in the fridge for a minimum of 2 weeks. A month would be better, and 2 better still.

## Tips

- For optimal flavor, age the eggnog for at least 2 weeks, and ideally 1-2 months. Some prefer aging it up to a year or even two for a more mellow and integrated flavor.
- Using a stand mixer for beating the egg yolks, sugar, and nutmeg will make the process easier and quicker.
- Make sure to use clean, sealed containers for aging to ensure longevity and safety.
- Freshly grated nutmeg is highly recommended for the best flavor.

## Modifications

- **Spices**: Experiment with other spices like a cinnamon stick, cloves, allspice, or a scraped vanilla bean pod for different flavor profiles.
- **Alcohol**: While the recipe calls for Jamaican rum, cognac, and bourbon, you can adjust the ratio or substitute with other spirits like rye whiskey, sherry, Madeira, or tawny port. Some have also successfully used smoky scotch.
