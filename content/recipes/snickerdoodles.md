**Prep time**: 15 minutes  
**Cook time**: 10–12 minutes  
**Total time**: 25–30 minutes  
**Yield**: About 24 cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened

- 2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar, eggs, flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Mix well until dough forms.
3. Roll dough into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter).
4. Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat.
5. Place balls on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each slightly with the bottom of a glass.

## Tips

- For a crispier cookie, bake an extra minute or two.
- Don't overbake—snickerdoodles should be soft in the center.
- Use parchment paper for easy cleanup and even baking.
- Make a double batch and freeze some dough balls for quick cookies anytime!
