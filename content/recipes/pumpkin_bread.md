**Prep time**: 20 minutes  
**Cook time**: 65 minutes  
**Total time**: 1 hour 30 minutes  
**Servings**: 2 loaves

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1½ sticks (¾ cup) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 (15-oz) can 100% pure pumpkin (such as Libby’s)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans with butter and dust with flour, or use a baking spray with flour.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes.
4. Beat in the pumpkin. The mixture may look curdled — this is normal.
5. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined.
6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 65–75 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Cool the loaves in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool completely on a wire rack.

## Tips

- Fresh out of the oven, the loaves have a deliciously crisp crust. Toast individual slices later to recapture that fresh-baked texture.
- **Freezer-friendly**: Once completely cooled, wrap loaves tightly in foil or place in freezer bags. Freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.
