Japanese milk bread is unlike any other bread out there. It has a super soft, fluffy, and flakey texture, which is a product of using the Tangzhong method. Follow this recipe to make either dinner rolls or a loaf of bread.

**Prep time**: 2 hours 30 minutes
**Cook time**: 20 minutes (for dinner rolls)
**Total time**: 2 hours 50 minutes
**Servings**: 6

## Ingredients

### Tangzhong

- 2 tbsp flour, 20g
- 2 tbsp water, 27g
- 4½ tbsp milk, 60g

### Yeast Mixture

- 1 tbsp active dry yeast or instant yeast, 10g
- 2 tbsp lukewarm water, 20g

### Main Dough

- Tangzhong
- Yeast mixture
- 2⅓ cup AP flour, 380g
- ¼ cup sugar, 60g
- 1 tsp salt, 3g
- ½ cup milk, 130g
- 1 large egg
- 3 tbsp softened unsalted butter

### Finishing

- 1 large egg (for egg wash)
- Garlic butter (for dinner rolls, optional)
- Butter (for loaf, optional)

## Instructions

### Mixing and First Proof

1.  If using **active dry yeast**, add it into the lukewarm water, mix, and allow to sit for 10 minutes until it blooms. If you are using **instant yeast**, skip this step. (1 tbsp active dry yeast or instant yeast, 2 tbsp lukewarm water)
2.  In a saucepan, add the tangzhong ingredients (2 tbsp flour, 2 tbsp water, 4½ tbsp milk) and cook, continuing to stir over low heat until a thick, paste-like substance forms. You should be able to pick all of it up with a spoon.
3.  Add your yeast mixture and tangzhong along with the remaining dough ingredients (2⅓ cup AP flour, ¼ cup sugar, 1 tsp salt, ½ cup milk, 1 large egg) _except_ for the softened butter in a stand mixer bowl. If you are using instant yeast, add the yeast and water in at this stage. Mix on low speed for 5 minutes or until a proper dough forms.
4.  Add your softened butter, 1 tbsp at a time, and mix on medium speed until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough is very smooth. If your dough is too sticky, add more flour 1 tbsp at a time until manageable.
5.  Allow your dough to proof in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap, for 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.

### Dinner Roll Method

1.  Portion the dough into 75g pieces. When shaping, make sure to form surface tension on the dough balls for a smooth look. Place them into a 9-inch cake pan, leaving 1cm of space between each.
2.  Allow them to rest for another 1 hour for the second proof.
3.  Brush with egg wash (1 beaten egg) and bake in the oven at **350°F for 20 minutes**.
4.  Top with garlic butter and enjoy.

### Loaf Method

1. Separate your dough into 3 equal pieces (about 250g each).
2. Flatten each piece into a rectangle.
3. Fold the long sides towards the middle.
4. Roll it up and seal the edge towards the bottom.
5. Place into an oiled 9-inch loaf pan, leaving 1 inch of space between each roll.
6. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof for 1 hour.
7. Brush with egg wash (1 beaten egg).
8. Bake at **350°F for 25-30 minutes**. I like to immediately brush with butter and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

## Tips

- Use weighted measurements (grams) for accuracy instead of volume measurements (cups/tbsp) to ensure the best results.
- Ensure your butter is softened, not melted, before adding it to the dough.
- Be patient when incorporating the softened butter; the dough will look broken at first, but it will come together after a couple of minutes of mixing.
