These homemade bagels are chewy, soft, and remarkably easy to make with just five basic pantry ingredients. Boiling the dough before baking ensures a traditional New York-style crust that is perfectly golden and shiny.

**Prep time**: 2 hours, 10 minutes
**Cook time**: 25 minutes
**Total time**: 3 hours
**Servings**: 8 bagels

## Ingredients

### Bagel Dough
- 1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water (between 100-110°F)
- 2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) (1 standard packet) instant or active dry yeast
- 1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar
- 4 cups (500g) bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for work surface
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons olive oil or nonstick spray (for coating the bowl)

### Water Bath
- 2 quarts (1.9L) water
- 1/4 cup (85g) honey or barley malt syrup

### Egg Wash & Toppings
- 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water
- Optional toppings: everything bagel seasoning, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or coarse salt

## Instructions

### Prepare the Dough
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, whisk the warm water, sugar, and yeast together. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.
2. Add the bread flour and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes until the dough starts to come together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. 
3. **Knead the dough**: Continue beating on low-medium speed for an additional 6–7 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6–7 minutes, until the dough is smooth, supple, and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add 1 more tablespoon of flour.

### First Rise
4. Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment until doubled in size, about 60–90 minutes.

### Shape the Bagels
6. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. 
7. Punch the risen dough down to release air bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces (about 4 ounces or 113g each).
8. Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5–2 inches in diameter. Loosely cover the shaped bagels and let them rest for 10 minutes.

### Water Bath & Toppings
9. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
10. Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water and whisk in the honey or barley malt syrup. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high.
11. Drop 2-3 bagels into the boiling water at a time. Boil for 1 minute, flip over, and boil for 1 minute more. Use a slotted spatula to remove the bagels and place them back on the prepared baking sheets.
12. Brush the tops and sides of the warm bagels with the egg wash. Sprinkle with desired toppings.

### Bake
13. Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the bagels are golden brown.
14. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheets for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

## Tips
- **Flour Choice**: Always use bread flour for bagels. Its high protein content is what provides the signature chewy texture.
- **Yeast**: Ensure your water is between 100-110°F; if it is too hot, it will kill the yeast, and if it is too cold, the dough won't rise.
- **Shine**: Do not skip the honey or barley malt syrup in the water bath, as it creates the distinct shiny, caramelized crust.
- **Stickiness**: If the dough sticks to the parchment paper after boiling, sprinkle a little cornmeal on the parchment before placing the boiled bagels on it.

## Modifications
- **Everything Bagels**: Use everything bagel seasoning (poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried onion, dried garlic, and salt) as the topping.
- **Cinnamon Raisin**: Add 3/4 cup raisins and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough when adding the flour and salt.
- **Cheese Bagels**: Add 1/2 cup of shredded Asiago or Cheddar cheese to the dough, and sprinkle more on top after the egg wash.
- **Barley Malt Syrup**: For a more authentic "NY Bagel" flavor, substitute the sugar in the dough and the honey in the water bath with barley malt syrup.
