**Prep time**: 2 hours 40 minutes  
**Cook time**: 1 hour 20 minutes  
**Total time**: 4 hours  
**Yield**: 8 servings

## Ingredients

### For the Filling:

- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 cup whole milk\*
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or heavy whipping cream\*
- 1/4 tsp salt\*
- 1/4 tsp pepper\*
- 1 cup shredded or crumbled cheese (feta, cheddar, goat cheese, gruyere, etc.)
- Up to 2 cups of add-ins (see variations below)

### For the Crust:

- 1 unbaked Flaky Pie Crust (or All-Butter Pie Crust)\*

### Optional Toppings:

- Extra cheese
- Chopped herbs
- Hollandaise sauce
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Pie Crust:

- Make pie dough at least one day ahead, as it needs to chill for 2+ hours.
- Roll chilled dough into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface.
- Fit into a 9-inch pie dish. Fold excess dough under and crimp or flute the edges.
- Chill crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (up to 5 days).

### 2. Blind Bake the Crust:

- Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
- Line the chilled crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
- Bake for 15–16 minutes until edges start to brown.
- Carefully lift out the parchment and weights. Prick the crust bottom with a fork.
- Return to oven for 7–8 minutes more until the bottom just begins to brown.
- Remove and let cool slightly. (You can blind-bake up to 3 days in advance; cover and chill if doing so.)

### 3. Prepare the Filling:

- Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (177°C).
- In a large bowl, beat eggs, milk, cream, salt, and pepper together for about 1 minute.
- Whisk in cheese and add-ins.
- Pour filling into the pre-baked pie crust.

### 4. Bake the Quiche:

- Bake for 45–55 minutes, or until the center is just set.
- Use a pie crust shield or foil to prevent over-browning of crust edges if needed.
- Let cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
- Serve warm or at room temperature.

## Tips

- **Storage**: Cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Reheat or serve cold.
- **Freezing**: Cool fully, wrap tightly, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw and reheat at 350°F for 20–25 minutes.
- **Pre-cook add-ins**: Vegetables and proteins should be cooked before adding. Pat dry to avoid excess moisture.
- **Salt adjustment**: Reduce salt if using salty add-ins like bacon or feta.
