**Prep time**: 5 mins
**Cook time**: 15 mins 
**Total time**: 20 mins
**Yield**: 6 servings

## Ingredients

- 4 cups chicken stock (about 1 liter, organic or homemade preferred)
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric (or 5 drops yellow food coloring; optional for color)
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch (mixed with 1/3 cup water)
- 3 eggs (lightly beaten)
- 1 scallion (chopped)
- 1/4 teaspoon MSG (adjust to taste; optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, and MSG if using. Add turmeric or food coloring for a classic yellow color. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
2. Stir in the cornstarch slurry slowly while continuously stirring the soup to avoid lumps. Adjust the amount of slurry depending on your preferred thickness. Simmer for a couple of minutes to check consistency.
3. Using a ladle, stir the soup in a circular motion. Slowly drizzle in the lightly beaten eggs to create swirls or "egg flowers." The stirring speed will affect the size of the egg ribbons.
4. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with chopped scallions, and serve!

## Tips

- Make sure the cornstarch slurry is well mixed right before adding—it settles quickly.
- Stir slowly for larger egg ribbons, or quickly for finer strands.
- MSG is optional, but it enhances the umami flavor.
- Adjust seasoning and thickness based on personal preference.
