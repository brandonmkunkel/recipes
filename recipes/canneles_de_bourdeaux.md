## Ingredients

### Batter:

- 2 vanilla beans (preferably Madagascan)
- 500 ml cold milk
- 200 g cane sugar (use 250 g for a more traditional sweetness)
- 100 g all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
- 50 g melted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 4 tbsp dark rum

### Mold Coating:

- 40 g beeswax
- 60 g butter

## Instructions

### Preparing the Molds (First Time Use):

1. Clean new copper molds.
2. Coat with butter and place in a 250°C (500°F) oven for 20 minutes.
3. Remove, wipe clean with a paper towel while hot, and allow to cool.
4. Never wash molds with water—wipe with a dry cloth after each use.

### Making the Batter:

1. Slit vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.
2. In a saucepan, heat milk with vanilla seeds and pods. Bring to a gentle simmer, then remove from heat and let steep for 2 minutes.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, and yolks.
4. Add melted butter and mix until combined.
5. Remove vanilla pods from the milk. Gradually add 1/4 of the hot milk to the egg mixture to temper, mixing well.
6. Add flour and stir to combine.
7. Slowly pour in the remaining milk, mixing continuously until smooth.
8. Stir in the rum.
9. Refrigerate the batter for at least 24 hours (48 hours preferred) to improve flavor and texture. Stir vigorously for 2 minutes before each use.

### Coating the Molds:

1. Melt 40 g beeswax and 60 g butter together (microwave for ~1 minute 45 seconds until it just starts to boil).
2. Warm molds until just warm to the touch.
3. Quickly pour wax mixture into each mold to the top, then immediately pour out into the next mold or container.
4. Invert molds onto a rack with paper towels to drain excess.
5. Chill molds in freezer or fridge until ready to bake.

### Baking:

1. Preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).
2. Fill molds with batter up to 1 cm (3/8 inch) from the top.
3. Place molds on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 550°F for 10 minutes.
4. Without opening the oven, reduce temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for another 45–50 minutes. Adjust time as needed based on your oven.
5. Remove molds from oven and immediately unmold canelés onto a cooling rack (tap molds on a hard surface if needed).
6. Let cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

### Serving:

- Canelés are best eaten the day they are baked.

## Tips

- The 60 g beeswax and 90 g butter mix is enough to coat about 20 standard 2-inch molds.
- If wax coating is too thin, molds may be overheated; warm molds to just touchable temperature.
- Always stir the batter thoroughly before pouring to ensure even consistency.
- For best results, avoid skipping the 24–48 hour refrigeration period.
