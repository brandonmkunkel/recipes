# 🥞 Classic Pancake Recipe

A quick and easy recipe for fluffy, homemade pancakes.

## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour  
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 1 tablespoon white sugar  
- 1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk  
- 1 egg  
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)  
- Butter or oil for cooking  

## 🍳 Instructions

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
2. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix until smooth. Add vanilla extract if using.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
4. Pour or scoop about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the griddle.
5. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until browned, about 1–2 minutes.
6. Serve hot with your favorite toppings like syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.

## 🍽 Tips

- Don’t overmix the batter — a few lumps are okay.
- For extra fluffiness, let the batter rest for 5–10 minutes before cooking.
- Add blueberries, chocolate chips, or bananas for variations.

Enjoy your pancakes! 🥞
