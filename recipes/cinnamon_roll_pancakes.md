**Total time**: 20 mins


## Ingredients

**Cinnamon Filling:**
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
- 1⁄4 cup + 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar  
- 1⁄2 tablespoon ground cinnamon  

**Cream Cheese Glaze:**
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter  
- 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature  
- 3⁄4 cup powdered sugar  
- 1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla extract  

**Pancakes:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour  
- 2 teaspoons baking powder  
- 1⁄2 teaspoon salt  
- 1 cup milk  
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten  
- 1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil  

## Instructions

1. **Make the cinnamon filling:** In a medium bowl, combine brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon. Scoop the mixture into a small plastic bag and set aside.  
2. **Make the glaze:** In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside.  
3. **Make the pancake batter:** In a bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil. Combine wet and dry ingredients.  
4. **Cook the pancakes:** Heat a skillet over medium-low and spray with non-stick spray. Pour about 1⁄2 cup batter into the skillet. When bubbles start to form, snip a small corner off the bag with the cinnamon filling and swirl it into the pancake (avoid edges). Flip with a wide metal spatula and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.  
5. Wipe out the pan between each pancake. Repeat with remaining batter. Warm the glaze if needed and drizzle over pancakes before serving.  

## Tips

- Before using the cinnamon filling, open the bag and stir to make sure the butter is fully incorporated.
