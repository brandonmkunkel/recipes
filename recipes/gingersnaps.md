# Gingersnaps

Friends and family will gobble up these crispy, spicy gingersnaps straight off the cooling rack.

**Yield:** 60 cookies
**Cost Per Serving:** \$0.13

## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking sodagingersnaps.md
* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1/4 cup unsulphured (mild) molasses
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, baking soda, ginger, salt, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium bowl.
2. With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary, about 3 minutes.
3. Reduce speed to medium-low and beat in molasses, egg, and vanilla until smooth.
4. Reduce speed to low, beat in flour mixture in 2 batches just until blended; continue to blend with a rubber spatula.
5. Refrigerate dough, covered, for at least 1 hour, or until very firm.
6. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375Â°F.
7. Grease 4 large baking sheets. Place remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl.
8. Shape dough into 1-inch balls, roll each in sugar, and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets.
9. Bake cookies (2 sheets at a time) for 10 to 15 minutes, switching positions on oven racks halfway through, until tops of cookies are cracked and fall just slightly when very lightly touched.
10. Let cookies cool on sheets on wire racks for about 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

## Tips

* For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them and allow them to finish setting on the baking sheet.
* Make sure the butter is truly at room temperature to ensure even mixing.
* Dough can be made in advance and refrigerated overnight for even deeper flavor.
