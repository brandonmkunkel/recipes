**Total time**: 1 hour 40 minutes
**Servings**: 6 cups

## Ingredients

**For the Bisque:**
- 4 lobster tails
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh tarragon, chopped
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cracked pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon lavender
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 cups dry white wine (or sherry)
- 4 cups lobster stock (or seafood/fish stock)
- 3/4 - 1 cup heavy cream

**For the Garlic Butter Lobster Meat:**
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pinch salt, to taste
- 1 pinch pepper, to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne, to taste

## Instructions

**1. Make the Lobster Stock:**
1. Fill a large pot with 5 cups of water and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Bring to a boil.
2. Add the lobster tails, cover with a lid, and boil for 5 minutes or until bright red.
3. Remove lobster tails, reserving the liquid stock in the pot.
4. Return lobster shells back to the water in the pot. Bring to a boil again, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. While stock is simmering, carefully remove the lobster meat from the shells (slice down the back with kitchen shears, pull halves apart, gently release meat). Chop the meat into bite-sized pieces and refrigerate until needed.
6. Remove the lobster shells from the stock and discard them. Set the lobster stock aside.

**2. Make the Bisque:**
1. In a large, heavy-based pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the finely chopped onions, carrots, celery, and fresh thyme and tarragon. Sweat the vegetables for about 5 minutes, until softened.
3. Season with chicken bouillon powder, salt, cracked pepper, lavender, and cayenne pepper.
4. Stir in 4 cloves of minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a further minute to coat the vegetables.
6. Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.
7. Pour in the dry white wine (or sherry). Simmer and let it reduce by half, about 5 minutes.
8. Add the reserved lobster stock to the mixture and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the soup to thicken slightly.
9. Remove the pot from the heat. Carefully transfer the soup mixture to a blender (fill only halfway to prevent heat buildup and potential splashing). Blend until completely smooth. Pour blended soup into a clean large pot and repeat until all the soup is smooth.
10. Return the pot to medium heat. Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Do not boil once cream is added.

**3. Make the Garlic Butter Lobster Meat:**
1. In a separate skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.
2. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add the chopped lobster meat, season with a pinch of salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Lightly sauté for 1 minute while stirring occasionally, until the lobster meat is just warmed through.

**4. Serve:**
1. Ladle the hot lobster bisque into bowls.
2. Top with a generous amount of garlic butter lobster meat.
3. Garnish with a little extra fresh tarragon, if desired.

## Tips

- For the smoothest bisque, use a high-powered blender.
- Ensure the bisque does not come to a rolling boil after the cream is added to prevent it from curdling.
- Dice your vegetables finely to ensure easier blending and a smoother texture.
- Don't overcrowd the blender; blend in batches if necessary.

## Modifications

- **For a richer flavor**: You can roast the lobster shells before making the stock for a deeper roasted flavor.
- **For a different alcohol**: Instead of dry white wine or sherry, you can use brandy or cognac. Flambé the alcohol briefly before adding other liquids if desired.
- **For a thicker bisque**: You can add a tablespoon or two of cooked white rice to the blending step.
- **For added spice**: Increase the amount of cayenne pepper to your preference.
