# Classic Challah

This deep-gold, light-textured bread is traditionally served on the Jewish Sabbath and holidays. Smooth and supple, the dough is perfect for braiding—whether you choose a simple three-strand, elegant four-strand, or striking six-strand braid.

**Prep time**: 20 minutes  
**Cook time**: 30 minutes  
**Total time**: 3 hours 50 minutes  
**Servings**: 1 large 16" loaf

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 4 to 4 1/4 cups (480g to 510g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  
- 3/4 cup (170g) lukewarm water  
- 6 tablespoons (74g) vegetable oil  
- 3 tablespoons (63g) honey  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1 large egg yolk (reserve the white for topping)  
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) table salt  
- 4 teaspoons (12g) instant yeast  

### Topping
- 1 large egg white (from above), beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water  
- Poppy seeds or sesame seeds (optional)  

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine 480g of flour with the rest of the dough ingredients. Mix and knead by hand, mixer, or bread machine until you have a soft, smooth dough. If sticky, add up to 1/4 cup (30g) more flour.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for about 2 hours, until puffy.
3. Gently deflate the dough and place it on a lightly greased surface.
4. Divide the dough depending on your preferred braid (3, 4, or 6 strands). Roll each piece into a 20" rope. If the dough resists, rest it for 10 minutes before continuing.
5. Braid the dough as desired. Transfer to a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet.
6. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise until very puffy, 60 to 90 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 375°F toward the end of the rise time.
8. Mix the reserved egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Brush over the loaf and sprinkle with seeds, if using.
9. Bake on the upper oven rack for 25 to 30 minutes, until deep golden and internal temperature reads 190°F.
10. Cool on a wire rack.

## Tips

- **Updated 3/16/21**: Recipe revised to speed preparation and enhance flavor by adjusting water, yeast, and eggs.
- **Rosh Hashanah spiral**: For a spiral loaf, roll dough into a 36" rope and coil in a greased 9" cake pan. Rise and bake as directed.
- **Whole wheat option**: Substitute white whole wheat flour. Rest dough for 20 minutes before kneading. Add water as needed for a smooth texture.
- **Make ahead**: After braiding, cover and refrigerate overnight. Next day, let rise 60 minutes at room temp before baking.
- Leftovers are great toasted, or used for grilled sandwiches or French toast. Store at room temperature for a few days or freeze for longer storage.
